LightVerifier is a set of tools to remotely verify the integrity of Linux systems. In essence, it uses 
a computer’s Trusted Platform Module and some Linux kernel features to track what programs execute, in such a way that the software on the machine cannot lie about what’s running. This is known as a hardware-based remote attestation. 
Therefore, unauthorised software modifications or execution can be detected in near real time. 

The aim of the project is to provide a standard set of remote attestation tools that emphasise simplicity and modularity. Through this approach, more complex monitoring systems can be built on top of common functionalities simply by invoking the tools.   

The dependencies for the tools are relatively minimal, and yet we are always looking for ways to reduce them. 

We can produce a verification database (to certain degrees) for a variety of Linux distributions (long-term-support (LTS) distributions only) including:

* Debian 
* Ubuntu (LTS versions)
* CentOS
